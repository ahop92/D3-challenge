          <h2><br>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income by State in the United States of America<br></h2>
          
          <p>Using data from the 2014 American Community Survey (ACS) Year 1 estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau, our team prepared the above visualization
            in an effort to reveal any correlations between various types of disparities or demographics within a given state. 
             </br></br>
            
            <b>Instructions:</b> The data visualization above allows the user
            to compare two sets of data to one another. The y-axis on the left-hand-side of the graph contains the following options: percentage of 
            citizens in the state lacking healthcare, percentage of population defined as obese, and percentage of the population that smokes. The x-axis
            on the bottom portion of the graph contains the following groups: percentage of population experiencing poverty, median age of the population, median 
            income of the population. Each demographic/disparity is user-clickable.
          </p>
          <b>Observations:</b> Our team noticed that when comparing the healthcare percentage against household income and poverty, the graphs appear to almost be mirror images
          of one another. This is unsurprising, since since a higher rate of poverty could easily be associated with lower median household income. <br><br>
          
          States in the south, west, and southwest consistently rank highest among all of the disparity metrics provided with the most consistent offenders for poverty rate, smoking
          and obesity being WV, AR, AL, KY, LA, MS, and NM. Surprisingly, however, some of these states (WV, DC, and KY) show some of the lowest rates of percentage of population
          that lacks healthcare among all survey data. <br><br>

          Please note that the axes adjust themselves depending on the metric selected. With that in mind, it's critical to state that the overall rates of obesity for all surveyed states is
          generally higher than that for smoking. While the scale for the states lacking healthcare is lower than its counterparts in the y-axis group, only 12 states out of 50 have a rate 
          of lacking healthcare lower than 10%. 10% of the smallest state population in the U.S. still amounts to about 57,685 people. By that standard, there is truly a tremendous
          number of people uninsured medically in the U.S. given how much larger certain state populations can be.

          <p>
            Finally, with respect to observed trends, there is a suggested linear relationship in the United States between the percentage of the population that lacks healthcare
            and the rate of poverty in a given state. In fact, this relationsship type stands for obestiy and smoking as well. Interestingly, when median age was evaluated in comparison 
            to the avaialble disparity metrics, the percentage lacking healthcare, percentage of the population defined as obese, and the percentage of those who smoke was uniformly concentrated
            in the age range of roughly 32-44 with the exception of Utah which acted as an outlier around the age of 30 across all three metrics on the y-axis.
